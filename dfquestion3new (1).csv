0,American Writers Museum,"The American Writers Museum—tucked away on the second floor of an office building—exist a high-tech literary wonderland. Inspired by the Dublin Writers Museum, the museum is an interactive, immersive approach over the old-school library vibe. A literal rainbow of books line the ceiling, A Nation of Writers exhibit is home to a comprehensive timeline of American literary history—with special attention paid to women and writers of color. Two of the museum’s premiere highlights are the Surprise Bookshelf, a playground of sights and sounds and smells, and the Word Waterfall that is both mesmerizing and endless.  There is also an impressive collection of usable typewriters, on which guests can write their story. Walls and touchscreen tables gamify the writing experience. If you ever wanted to learn just how many authors enjoyed a good drink every now and then, here’s your chance. The museum hosts rotating exhibits and events along with author readings and children’s storytimes. The museum is available for event rentals just in case anyone wants to be married under Hemingway’s watchful eye.",http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/american-writers-museum,180.0,"180 N Michigan Ave Chicago, Illinois, 60601 United States",41.8856,-87.6249,0.664039253799143
1,Museum of the Weird,"The dime or dime store museum is by all accounts an endangered species. The first dime museum, “The American Museum,” was opened in 1841 by none other than P. T. Barnum himself. It represented a departure from high-class art and science museums, catering to a poorer crowd and offering items of a much more dubious nature. Part of the appeal of the dime store museum lay in arguing about what was real and what was a “humbug,” as P. T. Barnum called a hoax or fake display. Feejee mermaids (a type of fake or “gaff” taxidermy made from a monkey and a fish, sewn together to form an incredibly ugly “mermaid”) mixed with real exotic animals, and scientific instruments sat next to a loom run by a dog. Unfortunately, Barnum’s American Museum burned to the ground in 1865. Though many dime museums had disappeared by the 1920s, dime museums such as New York City’s Hubert’s Museum would remain open until the late 1960s. One of the best recreation dime museums, Baltimore’s American Dime Museum, opened in 1999 only to shutter its doors in 2007. So though it may not look like much at first, “Austin’s Museum of the Weird” is, in fact, a rare beast. Created by artist-entrepreneur Steve Busti, the museum lives in the back of his store, the “Lucky Lizard,” and features many of the same types of curios you might have encountered in a turn-of-the-century dime museum, including a feejee mermaid. Among the other items shown are a cyclops pig, a hand of glory (supposedly the dried and pickled hand of a man who has been hanged), a two-headed chicken, shrunken heads, and mummies. Followed by a tour of their very own Wax Museum, then you’ll be ushered into a dark room and shown their special exhibit, “The Minnesota Iceman”, a decades-old mystery.  Lastly, you’ll be shown into a theater (where Johnny Depp once stayed) and given a live sideshow performance. A rotating cast means you’ll see “The Black Scorpion” perform a traditional show, John T. Rex hold a live wire in his bare hands, “The Amazing Face” hurt himself, and a three-legged dog. (Note, performers work for tips.) Though more expensive than a dime, the Museum of the Weird happily continues the tradition of the dime store museum. Tickets are $12",http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/museum-weird,1013.0,"Museum of the Weird 412 E 6th St. Austin, Texas, 78701 United States",30.267,-97.7387,0.5561687847519227
2,Siriraj Medical Museum,"The Siriraj Medical Museum abounds with medical curiosities. It is housed in Siriraj Hospital, Thailand’s oldest hospital and medical school, which was established in 1886 and is where the King of Thailand goes when he is ill. The Siriraj is actually comprised of six different museums: a museum of pathology, a forensics museum, a museum of the history of Thai medicine, a parasitology museum, an anatomical museum, and a prehistoric museum. The Ellis Pathological Museum is the oldest of the six museums, founded by the American pathologist Dr. Aller G. Ellis. He collected organs from patients who had been diagnosed with common disorders such as heart disease and cancer,  to serve as teaching tools for medical students.  The Siriraj’s incredible holdings include bones, preserved organs, pathological fetuses, the mummified corpse of a notorious serial killer, a traditional Thai medicine shop, parasitic worms, a two-and-a-half-foot-wide scrotum removed from a man afflicted with elephantiasis, preserved sections of human skin bearing tattoos, poisonous snakes and tarantulas, rows of skulls, the standing wax-filled remains of a cannibal, a delicately dissected nervous system, and the skeleton of the museum’s founder. A strong stomach is recommended. The Siriraj Museum website has lovely panoramic images of each museum.

3,National World War II Museum,"Perhaps once thought too narrowly focused, this museum was originally called the “National D-Day Museum” and concentrated primarily on events surrounding the famed D-Day offensive by Allied forces at the end of World War II. The star of this museum was the Higgins Boat – the iconic amphibious warfare boat used to deliver Allied troops onto the beaches of Normandy (and subsequently featured in any number of Hollywood productions). The Higgins Boat was designed and built in New Orleans, and thus the city became the chosen location for the museum. The museum got its current name in 2006 after an act of Congress two years prior officially designated the museum as “America’s National World War II Museum,” formalized an affiliation with the Smithsonian, and slightly widened its scope. Today the museum retains its focus on military history, skipping ahead two years into the war to focus exclusively on the United States’ involvement via immersive, high-production exhibitions with bombastic titles including Arsenal of Democracy and Campaigns of Courage (housed in buildings with names like US Freedom Pavilion and Hall of Democracy). Military history enthusiasts will enjoy the focus on strategy, troop movement, and weaponry. Other history buffs might bristle at abbreviated timelines and significant omissions from the American experience. Museum highlights include a multi-level observation deck that gives visitors unique views of restored airplanes hanging from the ceiling, and a high-tech, star-studded 4D film “Beyond All Boundaries” playing in the Victory Theater.",http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-world-war-ii-museum,1379.0,"945 Magazine Street New Orleans, Louisiana, 70130 United States",29.943,-90.0704,0.5050705554263617
4,Milwaukee Art Museum,"Like the Guggenheim in New York and the Oakland Museum in California, the building of the Milwaukee Art Museum is a piece of art in itself. Designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava, the museum is shaped liked a bird taking flight over the lake. Large metal beams extend from the museum, mimicking wings, and steel cables stretch into tail feathers. The beams descend in the evening, when the museum closes and the bird lands, and reopens each morning. If the magnificent structure weren’t compelling enough, the collection of the MAM is everything you want out of a small museum - comprehensive but precise with famous work alongside new pieces by great contemporary artists. One of Andy Warhols’ Brillo Boxes next to a Robert Smithson sculpture with Tara Donovan’s Bluffs, a sculpture made in 2009, in the background. Made of thousands of buttons, Bluffs recalls a Dr. Suess dream, a Martian landscape, and New Mexico. Hidden in the basement, the museum welcomes you to their “Chair Park” where visitors can sample the chairs usually kept behind glass: Frank Lloyd Wright’s Peacock Chair, Eero Saarinen’s Tulip Chair, and many others. The museum, along with the Chipstone Foundation, also created a permanent installation to display a vast collection of pottery and other objects called “Mrs. M—‘s Cabinet.”  The ghostlike projection of the fictional Mrs. M— tells the story of the  desire to travel the world for her collection. The museum also has galleries dedicated exclusively to Folk & Outsider American Art. Many of the objects do not have attribution but are simply “American.” Others were made by Edgar Tolson (a famous wood carver) or John W. Perates. This collection includes unique specimens from the Civil War era like canes that soldiers carved for themselves after the war honoring their fellow soldiers who perished and other events of the war.",http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/milwaukee-art-museum,1648.0,"700 N.

5,National Cryptologic Museum,"Update as of October 2021: Currently closed for renovations.  Update as of October 2022: The museum as reopened: The NCM will open on October 8, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. Following the opening, museum hours will be Tuesday through Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and Wednesday from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.  “Keep sending me the letters from the Archbishop of Silesia sent from Rome to Dresden. The key has been found here so that they can be read just like ordinary writing. But it is necessary to let them continue on their way while copying them exactly.” While these are the words of Naploean writing to his son, the sentiments, and the games that nations play have remained much the same. The letter above and much more can be found at the National Cryptologic Museum in Maryland. Opened to the public in December 1993 to much enthusiasm the museum is the only public museum in the Intelligence Community and covers the history of the National Security Agency as well as America’s cryptology history and legacy. The museum is located, appropriately, hidden away in the woods and next to the NSA, where much of today’s cryptology work is done. Among the many curious objects are a voice-encrypting phone used by numerous Presidents, a reconnaissance satellite from the 1960s, and the gem for cryptologist enthusiasts an incomparable library of declassified books on cryptology, and original texts including Johannes Trithemius’s Polygraphiae published in 1518. Museum visitors can also examine such famous machines such as the ENIGMA Uhr created by the Germans to make codes during WWII – and first decrypted by the Polish Cipher Bureau and then by Alan Turing – as well as the TUNNY Cryptographic Machine sometimes referred to by the German military as Geheimschreiber, which can be translated into “secret writer” or “private secretary.” Visitors can also learn about the cryptologic story behind the Battle of Midway, Native American Code Talkers, the Zimmermann Telegram that played a significant role for U.S. entry into World War I, the Great Seal, and dozens of other stories throughout our nation’s history. Educational children’s programs are also very popular. The museum also features a NSA Hall of Honor exhibit as well as exhibits dedicated to women and African-Americans who made significant contributions to cryptologic history. Along with the museum, there is an extensive library featuring photographs, catalogs, and other articles relating to cryptography and cryptology.",http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/national-cryptologic-museum,320.0,"Canine Road Fort Meade, Maryland, 20755 United States",39.1117,-76.7711,0.49491190016551806
6,Museum of Russian Culture,"When you think San Francisco, you probably don’t think “babushka,” but the Museum of Russian Culture in Pacific Heights showcases Russian culture and the lives of notable Americans of Russian descent. For more than sixty years, the museum has been open to the public for free. The museum focuses on Russian life before the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. As well as the exhibition hall, the museum is a valuable resource for Russian scholars with rare periodicals from the pre-Revolution era and documents concerning Siberia and the Far East. The museum is located in the Russian Center of San Francisco, which teaches a range of classes on Russian folk dancing and operates a pre-school.

7,Geppi's Entertainment Museum,"It’s a unique place that can create a sentimental feeling of “back in the day,” for multiple generations. 85-year-old grandparents next to their college-aged grandchildren can both look back at the past with favor in the Geppi’s Entertainment Museum, where every inch is dedicated to nostalgic pop culture that resonates with every demographic. Following the example set by the audience it appeals to, the Geppi’s Museum puts turn of the century comic characters next to Pez dispensers and life-sized Batman models. Although covering the breadth of American pop culture in a single museum is a daunting and seemingly chaotic task, the museum orders the mayhem in neat sections based on major historical events and innovations. Starting from the very beginning, the museum features an exhibit on Baltimore’s earliest residents in the early 18th century. It then moves steadily through early 20th century newspapers, the Great Depression, television, and eventually multimedia and the internet. Whether you’re a fan of video games, Buster Brown, or just a history buff, the 16,000 square foot museum will have something that will pique your interest. Update June 2018: Geppi’s Entertainment museum has closed.

8,Whale Museum,"Nestled in the San Juan Islands, the Whale Museum is part natural history museum, part research station. The museum supports and does research on three pods of Orca whales living in the adjacent Salish Sea. Though Orca whales live around the world, they are particularly concentrated in the coastal waters of North America, from Alaska to Washington. In the Native American traditions of the Pacific Northwest, the Orca, or killer whale, is the ruler and guardian of the sea, for its pure size and strength. In their mythology, the whales live in houses and towns at the bottom of the sea. At the Whale Museum, the gallery teaches visitors about these amazing mammals, including a genealogy of the orcas in the Salish Sea. It also features a video on Orcas of the Northwest and has a whale phone where you can listen to the songs of different whales. Visitors must take a ferry to Friday Harbor, but the museum is near the ferry landing.",http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/whale-museum,275.0,"62 First St. N.

9,Sweet Home Cafe,"Thomas Downing was the oyster king. In 19th-century New York City, white customers knew the African American restaurant proprietor for his much-touted seafood specialties. What they didn’t know: Downing used the elite oyster bar’s basement to house people fleeing slavery, as a stop on the underground railroad. Today, you can order an oyster pan roast celebrating Downing at the Sweet Home Cafe, located inside the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture.   Divided into four regions, reflecting the Agricultural South, the Creole Coast, the North States, and the Western Range, the cafeteria pays homage to the rich African, Native American, Caribbean, Latin American, and European influences in African American cooking. From a Gullah take on the Hoppin’ John (a traditional Southern New Year’s staple) to Western-style pan roast rainbow trout with cornbread and mustard green stuffing, visitors can sample executive chef Jerome Grant’s playful takes on regional cultural classics.  The restaurant’s decor offers a guide to the importance of food in African American culture and the political struggle this cuisine has nourished. “Our food is our flag,” reads a quote from food writer Michael W. Twitty, emblazoned on the wall. “It sits at the intersection of the South, Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America.” Meanwhile, a photograph of the 1960 Greensboro Woolworth’s Lunch Counter sit-in spans the entire length of the cafeteria, reminding visitors of the people who fought to guarantee African Americans the right to enjoy equal access to public spaces like this very restaurant. Sweet Home Cafe isn’t the only Smithsonian effort to make food part of visitors’ overall cultural experience. A few blocks away at the National Museum of the American Indian, visitors can sample Native American foods at the Mitsitam Cafe. Like Mitsitam, Sweet Home Cafe demonstrates that there’s no such thing as a single “American” cuisine and celebrates the African Americans who have played an outsized role in shaping the country’s culinary culture.",http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/sweet-home-cafe,191.0,"National Museum of African American History and Culture 1400 Constitution Ave NW Washington, District of Columbia United States",38.8911,-77.0326,0.35181734343986387
